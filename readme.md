## Description: 
**Shang Dynasty: Spirit Messenger** is a side-scrolling adventure that immerses you in Bronze-Age China 
as a sacred courier. Navigate randomized mountains, lakes, and cliffs by choosing between a nimble bird, 
sturdy turtle, or swift deerâ€”each with unique strengths and spirit costs. Along the way, collect 
fragmented oracle words in the sky and on the ground to reconstruct and deliver a divine message 
to the heavens.
